SnapRevise is a Flask-based web application that helps students revise efficiently by generating interactive flashcards from images or text input. It combines OCR, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and text summarization to automate content extraction and transformation.

Key Features:
OCR (Pytesseract): Extracts raw text from uploaded images, scanned notes, or PDFs.

NLP (NLTK): Processes extracted text to identify key concepts, keywords, and generate question-answer pairs.

Text Summarization: Automatically condenses large chunks of content into brief, easy-to-learn summaries for quick revision.

Flashcards Generation: Creates clean, responsive flashcards based on either summaries or Q&A format.

Flask Web App: Lightweight and easy-to-use backend using Flask with TailwindCSS for the front-end.

Purpose:
SnapRevise simplifies the revision process by automating the conversion of lecture notes, textbooks, or handwritten material into structured flashcards and summaries â€” saving time while improving retention.
